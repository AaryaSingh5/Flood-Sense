🔹 Objective

This dashboard analyzes urban pluvial (rain-induced) flood risks by combining environmental, hydrological, and infrastructural parameters such as rainfall intensity, elevation, drainage proximity, land use, and soil type. It provides spatial, statistical, and predictive insights into urban flooding patterns.

🧭 Dashboard Pages
1️⃣ Dashboard Overview

Purpose:
Gives a high-level summary of key flood risk indicators — elevation, rainfall, drainage, and risk distribution — across cities and catchments.

2️⃣ Infrastructure Impact Report

Purpose:
Analyzes how land use, drainage infrastructure, and soil type influence flood risks.

3️⃣ Spatial Risk Mapping Report

Purpose:
Provides geospatial and regional-level flood hotspot mapping based on catchment and borough data.

4️⃣ Risk Forecasting Report

Purpose:
Forecasts and compares future flood risk trends using return periods, drainage, and rainfall features.
